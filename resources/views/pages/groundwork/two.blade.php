                                                In 2017, the Foundation requested assistance from Novartis to develop a mobile Application for management of data collected in NBS. The App, first of its kind globally, was designed by Dimagi (USA) on its CommCare platform based on the Ghana NBS Database designed by Prof. Kwaku Ohene-Frempong, the President of the Foundation, and funded by Novartis. The App was in use at every screening site.
