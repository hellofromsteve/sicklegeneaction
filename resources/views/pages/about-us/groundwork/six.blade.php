                                                                <p>✓ <strong>A High Burden of Disease:</strong> Even though Africa has the highest number of patients with this disease, health care for SCD patients in Africa has lagged far behind that in countries with well-organized programs.</p>
                                                                <p>✓ <strong>The Need for Well-Trained Personnel:</strong> The main reason for the difference in care for patients in Africa vs. care for patients in other countries may be a lack of material resources. However, inadequately trained personnel is another contributing factor. One of the main goals of the Center for Sickle Cell Disease in Kumasi is to develop and implement national and regional training programs in the diagnosis and management of SCD.</p>
